The project includes my exercises with arrays, loops, and script with exercises: basic algorithm scripting by freeCodeCamp.
 All i'ts in JavaScript.
To check the result of individual tasks, run the script via npm with the command:
`npm install`. In next step you can use `npm run loop`, or `npm run array`, or `npm run algo`.
