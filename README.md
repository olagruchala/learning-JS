The project includes my exercises with:
 * arrays, 
 * loops, 
 * basic algorithm scripting by freeCodeCamp.
 
 All i'ts in JavaScript.
 To check the result of individual tasks, run the script via npm with the command:
`npm install`. 

In next step you can use:
 * `npm run array`, or 
 * `npm run loop`, or 
 * `npm run algo`.
